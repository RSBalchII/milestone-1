       <h4>Savings</h4>
       <p>The cost of cannabis varies based on certain characteristics like hygiene, quality of cannabinoids, and cost of production. When purchasing cannabis you spend on average between 6-15$ a gram.
        Growing on your own could cost you 1/3rd of the cost that you would spend on few months worth of cannabis purchases. Along with those savings a grower can greatly increase the quality of cannabinoids using proper practices in their cultivation.</p>

        <h4>Hygiene</h4>
        <p>- Health benefits of gardening - When you grow your own garden you are in complete control of your fertilizer and pesticide usage.
          <br>- Pesticides - they come in natural and synthetic versions. The biggest difference between the two is the method of action. Many organic methods will capture pests to incapacitate pests and hopefully suffocate them. Synthetic pesticides tend to be concentrated insect harming poisons. With this caveat that organic poisons are available as well. Poisons should always be used as a last resort to save a harvest as cleaning a plant off is difficult especially when higher humidity of washing the plant down can cultivate mold.
          <br>- Mold/Mildew - this is one of the hardest hurdles you'll come across. The fungus most commonly afflicting cannabis is Powerdery Mildew in the 3rd stage and Botrytis commonly known as  "Bud Rot" in the 4th stage.
          <br> - Timely watering/fertilization- dry plants can develop diseases and mutations in order to adapt to a dry environment. This can result in smaller plants, smaller flowers, and weaker quality medicine.</p>

        <h4>Cultivation</h4>
        <p>Tending a cannabis garden is not for the faint of heart. If you've gotten this far then you may as well learn a thing or two about cannabis
          <br>- Phenotypes - Cannabis is the genus of the plant commonly smoked for it psychoactive effects. Cannabis is often called as "Sativa" or "Indica". This perceived difference comes from some characteristics of the psychoactive effects. While "Sativa" often is associated with tall and over long blooming periods the distinction is not so clear between the two types. Indica plants are believed to grow short and stout and perform well in cold weather. This is a vast simplification as some tall plants do well in overly cold environments while short ones do not.
          <br> - The important fact I have come to learn is that each plant will respond according to the genetics its parents provide it with. its prior lineage and phenotype will determine the outcome and only having grown a plant to fruition would one truly know how it grows and what quality of flower it provides.
          <br> - This means that determining outcomes isnt as cut and dry as "Sativa" and "Indica" as the genetic origins of the plant you get may well have physical and psychoactive characteristics of either.
          - Often with the help of websites like
          <a href="https://en.seedfinder.eu/">SeedFinder</a> we can look back at ways to determine a certain amount of plant lineage. This can give us an idea of the plant we expect to have when we pop seeds and begin to vegetate.</p>

        <h4>Growth Cycle - The 4 Stages</h4>
        <p> <strong>1. Germination stage:</strong> This involves the initial sprouting of the seed. The seed is soaked in water or planted directly into soil until it sprouts.
          <br> <strong>2. Vegetative stage:</strong>During this stage, the plant develops its leaves, stems, and roots. This stage can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the strain and growing conditions.
          <br> <strong>3. Flowering stage:</strong> In this stage, the plant begins to produce buds and flowers. This stage typically lasts around 8-10 weeks and is when the plant begins to produce the psychoactive compounds that are associated with cannabis use.
          <br> <strong>4. Harvesting and drying:</strong> Once the plant has matured, it is harvested and dried before it can be consumed or processed further. The timing of harvesting can vary depending on the desired effect and the strain being grown.

          <h4>Tips and Tricks!</h4>
          <p>Tips and tricks to get started !
            The decisions that must be made when you begin to plan your garden are what will determine the difficulty level of your growing situation. Decisions like "How many plants?","What kind of garden will I have? Indoor or Outdoor?", "What plants am I interested in?" It is always a good idea to determine the amount of time you wish to put into a garden as Cannabis is a thirsty plant and to get usable medicine in the end requires dedication and an eye for detail.
            <br> A list of rules of thumb that I live by when considering starting a new cultivation are as follows.
            <br> - Know the weather and conditions! you can get tools to measure the humidity of the space (especially for indoor gardens), temperature, and Ph of the water you are using.
            <br> - Temperature is key- The ideal temperature for cannabis varies slightly over its growth stages. If you grow outside then consider your weather forecasts to determine when to start your cultivation. If you are growing indoors then in stage 1 the temperature should be higher than 76 degrees but not higher than 90 degrees f. By stage 2 you should be finding a balance in between 75 degrees and 85 degrees. Stage 3 will call for lower temperatures close to 76 degrees. stage 4 will see you wanting to cool them down even more to about 70 degrees.
            <br> - A proper Ph for cannabis feeding is between 5.8 and 6.4. You can find amendments to water Ph at your local gardening store.
            <br> - Coco is easy! As a growing medium it is both fairly inexpensive and makes it easy for the cultivars to uptake the available elements in your fertilizer. You can find coco in most gardening stores and I recommend it for beginners.
            <br> - I recommend setting up your plants either with stakes to hold up heavy branches or a grid trellis system to pull them through and support the plants stems as they buds get heavier. this will also allow the plant to devote more of its limited energies to growing flowers and not stem.</p>
