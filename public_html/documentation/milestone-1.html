<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
    This website will seek to encourage people who use cannabis and enjoy its medicinal benefits with a few good reasons
    why they should grow it themselves.
</p>
<p>
    This website is a way for me to connect the good things I learned from my experiences in the cannabis industry with
    my new career path. In a way it would be cathartic.
</p>
<p>
    I also hope that making the website professional with a smooth interface will help me achieve good employment or
    figure out what I really want to do with coding. whether it is as employee or perhaps as an entrepreneur.
</p>
<h1>Audience</h1>
<p>
    This website would be for the people who are interested in growing their own cannabis and the main roles that exist
    would be - the amateur, the novice, the intermediate, the expert/master, the retiree, and the commercial planter.
</p>
<p>
    The Role I want to target will be the amateur. This will be a bit different from the novice as novices are already
    on the path to learning about the methods of growing. The amateur has possibly not been convinced to grow their on
    their own and could be persuaded into doing so with my website.
</p>
<h1>Goal</h1>
<p>
    The goal is to allow an amateur cannabis user to access the website and get enough information to switch to growing
    their own flower garden with little to no experience but some tools to find good resources on the topic.
</p>
<ul>
        the four main components of the argument should be -
    <li>
        1. the cost analysis benefit
        2. the ease of finding the correct plant “strain” for your ailment
        3. the hygiene of the final product
        4. the uses of final products of the grow cycle
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Persona</h1>
<h2>Name: Jefferson Funkyfellow</h2>
<p>
    Jeffery is on the fence about growing cannabis and if he does he needs some guidance on how to get started. If he
    can learn a bit more about some of the ins and outs of growing he would be able to take the plunge.
</p>
<p>
    Jeffery is using a Samsung phone and a laptop to access the internet and is an avid internet user so is frustrated
    when webpage UI is difficult to navigate on mobile or desktop modes.
</p>
<p>
    Their goal with accessing my website would be to get some understanding of how cannabis is grown as commercial
    enterprises often will not share information in that regard.
