    <h1><strong>Concept</strong></h1>
    <p>
        My concept is to appeal to people who have minor knowledge of cannabis and use it for medicinal benefits. I want them to consider growing it themselves in order to maintain their best interest in THC/CBD cannabis as medicine and have fun doing it! Sharing this knowledge is fun and interesting to me.
